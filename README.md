## Welcome to my Portfolio âš¡ðŸ‘‹

I am full stack developer and I love strong typed languages such as Typescript and Java. But when I am in a hurry my goto option is always Python. 
Okay that being said I like juggle between multiple languages and technologies and love to explore new avenues. 

## Techical Speciality: genericness (British English) 
### /dÊ’ÉªËˆnÉ›rÉªknÉ™s/  (Noun)
### 1. the state or quality of being generic   2.generic properties
- My work experience at Deloitte Consulting and Salesforce.com gave me repeated chances to specialize in making generic software solution. I have designed and built UI for a "No Code" application and implemented a generic metrics storage database augmented by a source agnostic ingestion and query APIs.  

## Life Philosophy  
### "A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one"
