## Welcome to my Portfolio âš¡ðŸ‘‹

I am full stack developer and I love strong typed languages such as Typescript and Java. But when I am in a hurry my goto option is always Python. 
Okay that being said I like juggle between multiple languages and technologies and love to explore new avenues. 

The philosophy by which I identify myself is : 
### "A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one"
